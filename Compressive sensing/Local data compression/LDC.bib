	Abstract = {{Nodes of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are typically powered by
   batteries with a limited capacity. Thus, energy is a primary constraint
   in the design and deployment of WSNs. Since radio communication is in
   general the main cause of power consumption, the different techniques
   proposed in the literature to improve energy efficiency have mainly
   focused on limiting transmission/reception of data, for instance, by
   adopting data compression and/or aggregation. The limited resources
   available in a sensor node demand, however, the development of
   specifically designed algorithms. To this aim, we propose an approach to
   perform lossy compression on single node based on a differential pulse
   code modulation scheme with quantization of the differences between
   consecutive samples. Since different combinations of the quantization
   process parameters determine different trade-offs between compression
   performance and information loss, we exploit a multi-objective
   evolutionary algorithm to generate a set of combinations of these
   parameters corresponding to different optimal trade-offs. The user can
   therefore choose the combination with the most suitable trade-off for
   the specific application. We tested our lossy compression approach on
   three datasets collected by real WSNs. We show that our approach can
   achieve significant compression ratios despite negligible reconstruction
   errors. Further, we discuss how our approach outperforms LTC, a lossy
   compression algorithm purposely designed to be embedded in sensor nodes,
   in terms of compression rate and complexity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

	Abstract = {{Wireless transmission of a single bit can require over 1000 times more
 energy than a single 32-bit computation. It can therefore be beneficial
 to perform additional computation to reduce the number of bits
 transmitted. If the energy required to compress data is less than the
 energy required to send it, there is a net energy savings and an
 increase in battery life for portable computers. This article presents a
 study of the energy savings possible by losslessly compressing data
 prior to transmission. A variety of algorithms were measured on a
 StrongARM SA-110 processor. This work demonstrates that, with several
 typical compression algorithms, there is a actually a net energy
 increase when compression is applied before transmission. Reasons for
 this increase are explained and suggestions are made to avoid it. One
 such energy-aware suggestion is asymmetric compression, the use of one
 compression algorithm on the transmit side and a different algorithm for
 the receive path. By choosing the lowest-energy compressor and
 decompressor on the test platform, overall energy to send and receive
 data can be reduced by 11\% compared with a well-chosen symmetric pair,
 or up to 57\% over the default symmetric zlib scheme.}},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to measure the temporal-spatial field of some scalar physical quantities. Our goal is to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the temporal-spatial field with as little energy as possible. We propose an adaptive algorithm, based on the recently developed theory of adaptive compressive sensing, to collect information from WSNs in an energy efficient manner. The key idea of the algorithm is to perform {\^A}¿projections{\^A}¿ iteratively to maximise the amount of information gain per energy expenditure. We prove that this maximisation problem is NP-hard and propose a number of heuristics to solve this problem. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms using data from both simulation and an outdoor WSN testbed. The results show that our proposed algorithms are able to give a more accurate approximation of the temporal-spatial field for a given energy expenditure.},

	Abstract = {{We propose a novel approach to reducing energy consumption in sensor
 networks using a distributed adaptive signal processing framework and
 efficient algorithm(1). While the topic of energy-aware routing to
 alleviate energy consumption in sensor networks has received attention
 recently {[}1,2]. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal approach to
 previous methods. Specifically, we propose a distributed way of
 continuously exploiting existing correlations in sensor data based on
 adaptive signal processing and distributed source coding principles. Our
 approach enables sensor nodes to blindly compress their readings with
 respect to one another without the need for explicit and
 energy-expensive inter-sensor communication to effect this compression.
 Furthermore, the distributed algorithm used by each sensor node is
 extremely low in complexity and easy to implement (i.e., one modulo
 operation), while an adaptive filtering framework is used at the data
 gathering unit to continuously learn the relevant correlation structures
 in the sensor data. Our simulations show the power of our proposed
 algorithms, revealing their potential to effect significant energy
 savings (from 10\%-65\%) for typical sensor data corresponding to a
 multitude of sensor modalities.}},

In this coding method, the transmitter and the receiver store past message terms, and from them estimate the value of the next message term. The transmitter transmits, not the message term, but the difference between it and its predicted value. At the receiver this error term is added to the receiver prediction to reproduce the message term. This procedure is defined and messages, prediction, entropy, and ideal coding are discussed to provide a basis for Part II, which will give the mathematical criterion for the best predictor for use in the predictive coding of particular messages, will give examples of such messages, and will show that the error term which is transmitted in predictive coding may always be coded efficiently.},

	Abstract = {We present distributed regression, an efficient and general framework for in-network modeling of sensor data. In this framework, the nodes of the sensor network collaborate to optimally fit a global function to each of their local measurements. The algorithm is based upon kernel linear regression, where the model takes the form of a weighted sum of local basis functions; this provides an expressive yet tractable class of models for sensor network data. Rather than transmitting data to one another or outside the network, nodes communicate constraints on the model parameters, drastically reducing the communication required. After the algorithm is run, each node can answer queries for its local region, or the nodes can efficiently transmit the parameters of the model to a user outside the network. We present an evaluation of the algorithm based upon data from a 48-node sensor network deployment at the Intel Research - Berkeley Lab, demonstrating that our distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a fast rate and is very robust to packet losses.},

@article{Ji2008,
	Abstract = {{The data of interest are assumed to be represented as N-dimensional real
 vectors, and these vectors are compressible in some linear basis B,
 implying that the signal can be reconstructed accurately using only a
 small number M << N of basis-function coefficients associated with B.
 Compressive sensing is a framework whereby one does not measure one of
 the aforementioned N-dimensional signals directly, but rather a set of
 related measurements, with the new measurements a linear combination of
 the original underlying N-dimensional signal. The number of required
 compressive-sensing measurements is typically much smaller than N,
 offering the potential to simplify the sensing system. Let f denote the
 unknown underlying N-dimensional signal, and g a vector of
 compressive-sensing measurements, then one may approximate f accurately
 by utilizing knowledge of the (under-determined) linear relationship
 between f and g, in addition to knowledge of the fact that f is
 compressible in B. In this paper we employ a Bayesian formalism for
 estimating the underlying signal f based on compressive-sensing
 measurements g. The proposed framework has the following properties: i)
 in addition to estimating the underlying signal f, ``error bars{''} are
 also estimated, these giving a measure of confidence in the inverted
 signal; ii) using knowledge of the error bars, a principled means is
 provided for determining when a sufficient number of compressive-sensing
 measurements have been performed; iii) this setting lends itself
 naturally to a framework whereby the compressive sensing measurements
 are optimized adaptively and hence not determined randomly; and iv) the
 framework accounts for additive noise in the compressive-sensing
 measurements and provides an estimate of the noise variance. In this
 paper we present the underlying theory, an associated algorithm, example
 results, and provide comparisons to other compressive-sensing inversion
 algorithms in the literature.}},

	Abstract = {{The efficient allocation of the limited energy resources of a wireless
 sensor network in a way that maximizes the information value of the data
 collected is a significant research challenge. Within this context, this
 article concentrates on adaptive sampling as a means of focusing a
 sensor's energy consumption on obtaining the most important data.
 Specifically, we develop a principled information metric based upon
 Fisher information and Gaussian process regression that allows the
 information content of a sensor's observations to be expressed. We then
 use this metric to derive three novel decentralized control algorithms
 for information-based adaptive sampling which represent a trade-off in
 computational cost and optimality. These algorithms are evaluated in the
 context of a deployed sensor network in the domain of flood monitoring.
 The most computationally efficient of the three is shown to increase the
 value of information gathered by approximately 83\%, 27\%, and 8\% per
 day compared to benchmarks that sample in a naive nonadaptive manner, in
 a uniform nonadaptive manner, and using a state-of-the-art adaptive
 sampling heuristic (USAC) correspondingly. Moreover, our algorithm
 collects information whose total value is approximately 75\% of the
 optimal solution (which requires an exponential, and thus impractical,
 amount of time to compute).}},

 sampling theory to sensor data gathering for large-scale wireless sensor
 networks. The successful scheme developed in this research is expected
 to offer fresh frame of mind for research in both compressive sampling
 applications and large-scale wireless sensor networks. We consider the
 scenario in which a large number of sensor nodes are densely deployed
 and sensor readings are spatially correlated. The proposed compressive
 data gathering is able to reduce global scale communication cost without
 introducing intensive computation or complicated transmission control.
 The load balancing characteristic is capable of extending the lifetime
 of the entire sensor network as well as individual sensors. Furthermore,
 the proposed scheme can cope with abnormal sensor readings gracefully.
 We also carry out the analysis of the network capacity of the proposed
 compressive data gathering and validate the analysis through ns-2
 simulations. More importantly, this novel compressive data gathering has
 been tested on real sensor data and the results show the efficiency and
 robustness of the proposed scheme.},

	Abstract = {{Energy is a primary constraint in the design and deployment of wireless
 sensor networks (WSNs), since sensor nodes are typically powered by
 batteries with a limited capacity. Energy efficiency is generally
 achieved by reducing radio communication, for instance, limiting
 transmission/reception of data. Data compression can be a valuable tool
 in this direction. The limited resources available in a sensor node
 demand, however, the development of specifically designed compression
 algorithms. In this paper, we propose a simple lossless entropy
 compression (LEC) algorithm which can be implemented in a few lines of
 code, requires very low computational power, compresses data on the fly
 and uses a very small dictionary whose size is determined by the
 resolution of the analog-to-digital converter. We have evaluated the
 effectiveness of LEC by compressing four temperature and relative
 humidity data sets collected by real WSNs, and solar radiation, seismic
 and ECG data sets. We have obtained compression ratios up to 70.81\% and
 62.08\% for temperature and relative humidity data sets, respectively,
 and of the order of 70\% for the other data sets. Then, we have shown
 that LEC outperforms two specifically designed compression algorithms
 for WSNs. Finally, we have compared LEC with gzip, bzip2, rar, classical
 Huffman and arithmetic encodings.}},

	Abstract = {Recent work has shown that large gains in communication capacity are achievable by distributed beamforming in sensor networks. The principal challenge in realizing these gains in practice, is in synchronizing the carrier signal of individual sensors in such a way that they combine coherently at the intended receiver. In this paper, we provide a scalable mechanism for achieving phase synchronization in completely distributed fashion, based only on feedback regarding the power of the net received signal. Insight into the workings of the protocol is obtained from a simple theoretical model that provides accurate performance estimates},

It can therefore be beneficial to perform additional computation to reduce the number of bits transmitted. If the energy required to compress data is less than the energy required to send it, there is a net energy savings and an increase in battery life for portable computers. This article presents a study of the energy savings possible by losslessly compressing data prior to transmission. A variety of algorithms were measured on a StrongARM SA-110 processor. This work demonstrates that, with several typical compression algorithms, there is a actually a net energy increase when compression is applied before transmission. Reasons for this increase are explained and suggestions are made to avoid it. One such energy-aware suggestion is asymmetric compression, the use of one compression algorithm on the transmit side and a different algorithm for the receive path. By choosing the lowest-energy compressor and decompressor on the test platform, overall energy to send and receive data can be reduced by 11\% compared with a well-chosen symmetric pair, or up to 57\% over the default symmetric zlib scheme.}}, Address = {{2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA}}, Affiliation = {{Barr, KC (Reprint Author), State Ctr, Bldg 32-G776,32 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

	Abstract = {Compressibility of individual sequences by the class of generalized finite-state information-lossless encoders is investigated. These encoders can operate in a variable-rate mode as well as a fixed-rate one, and they allow for any finite-state scheme of variable-length-to-variable-length coding. For every individual infinite sequence x a quantity \rho(x) is defined, called the compressibility of x , which is shown to be the asymptotically attainable lower bound on the compression ratio that can be achieved for x by any finite-state encoder. This is demonstrated by means of a constructive coding theorem and its converse that, apart from their asymptotic significance, also provide useful performance criteria for finite and practical data-compression tasks. The proposed concept of compressibility is also shown to play a role analogous to that of entropy in classical information theory where one deals with probabilistic ensembles of sequences rather than with individual sequences. While the definition of \rho(x) allows a different machine for each different sequence to be compressed, the constructive coding theorem leads to a universal algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for all sequences.},

	Abstract = {{Since the inception of sensor networks, in-network processing has been
   touted as the enabling technology for long-lived deployments. Radio
   communication is the overriding consumer of energy in such networks.
   Therefore, data reduction before transmission, either by compression or
   feature extraction, will directly and significantly increase network
   lifetime.
   In many cases, it is premature to begin implementing feature extraction
   techniques. Users do not yet understand in what forms interesting data
   will appear and consequently can't risk automatically discarding what
   they presume to be uninteresting. Moreover, computer scientists are only
   beginning to develop algorithms to collect spatially distributed
   features in situ.
   Even for the many application where all of the data must be transported
   out of the network, data may be compressed before transport, so long as
   the chosen compression technique can operate under the stringent
   resource constraints of low-power nodes and induces only tolerable
   errors. This paper evaluates a simple temporal compression scheme
   designed specifically to be used by mica motes for the compaction of
   microclimate data. The algorithm makes use of the observation that over
   a small enough window of time, samples of microclimate data are linear.
   It finds such windows and generates a series of line segments that
   accurately represent the data. It compresses data up to 20-to-1 while
   introducing error on the order of the sensor hardware's specified margin
   of error. Furthermore it is simple, consumes little CPU and requires
   very little storage when compared to other compression techniques. This
   paper describes the technique and results using a dataset from a
   one-year microclimate deployment.}},
