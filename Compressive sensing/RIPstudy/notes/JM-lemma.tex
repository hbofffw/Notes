\chapter{Math basic: John-Lindenstrauss lemma}
The \textbf{\textcolor[rgb]{1,0,0}{Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma}} concerns low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional into low-dimensional into low-dimensional \emph{Euclidean space}. The lemma states that a small set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are nearly preserved. The map used for the embedding is at least Lipschitz, and can even be taken to be an orthogonal projection.
