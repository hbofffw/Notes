  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to measure the temporal-spatial field of some scalar physical quantities. Our goal is to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the temporal-spatial field with as little energy as possible. We propose an adaptive algorithm, based on the recently developed theory of adaptive compressive sensing, to collect information from WSNs in an energy efficient manner. The key idea of the algorithm is to perform Â¿projectionsÂ¿ iteratively to maximise the amount of information gain per energy expenditure. We prove that this maximisation problem is NP-hard and propose a number of heuristics to solve this problem. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms using data from both simulation and an outdoor WSN testbed. The results show that our proposed algorithms are able to give a more accurate approximation of the temporal-spatial field for a given energy expenditure.},

 networks using a distributed adaptive signal processing framework and
 efficient algorithm(1). While the topic of energy-aware routing to
 alleviate energy consumption in sensor networks has received attention
 recently {[}1,2]. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal approach to
 previous methods. Specifically, we propose a distributed way of
 continuously exploiting existing correlations in sensor data based on
 adaptive signal processing and distributed source coding principles. Our
 approach enables sensor nodes to blindly compress their readings with
 respect to one another without the need for explicit and
 energy-expensive inter-sensor communication to effect this compression.
 Furthermore, the distributed algorithm used by each sensor node is
 extremely low in complexity and easy to implement (i.e., one modulo
 operation), while an adaptive filtering framework is used at the data
 gathering unit to continuously learn the relevant correlation structures
 in the sensor data. Our simulations show the power of our proposed
 algorithms, revealing their potential to effect significant energy
 savings (from 10\%-65\%) for typical sensor data corresponding to a
 multitude of sensor modalities.}},

In this framework, the nodes of the sensor network collaborate to optimally fit a global function to each of their local measurements. The algorithm is based upon kernel linear regression, where the model takes the form of a weighted sum of local basis functions; this provides an expressive yet tractable class of models for sensor network data. Rather than transmitting data to one another or outside the network, nodes communicate constraints on the model parameters, drastically reducing the communication required. After the algorithm is run, each node can answer queries for its local region, or the nodes can efficiently transmit the parameters of the model to a user outside the network. We present an evaluation of the algorithm based upon data from a 48-node sensor network deployment at the Intel Research - Berkeley Lab, demonstrating that our distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a fast rate and is very robust to packet losses.},

 vectors, and these vectors are compressible in some linear basis B,
 implying that the signal can be reconstructed accurately using only a
 small number M << N of basis-function coefficients associated with B.
 Compressive sensing is a framework whereby one does not measure one of
 the aforementioned N-dimensional signals directly, but rather a set of
 related measurements, with the new measurements a linear combination of
 the original underlying N-dimensional signal. The number of required
 compressive-sensing measurements is typically much smaller than N,
 offering the potential to simplify the sensing system. Let f denote the
 unknown underlying N-dimensional signal, and g a vector of
 compressive-sensing measurements, then one may approximate f accurately
 by utilizing knowledge of the (under-determined) linear relationship
 between f and g, in addition to knowledge of the fact that f is
 compressible in B. In this paper we employ a Bayesian formalism for
 estimating the underlying signal f based on compressive-sensing
 measurements g. The proposed framework has the following properties: i)
 in addition to estimating the underlying signal f, ``error bars{''} are
 also estimated, these giving a measure of confidence in the inverted
 signal; ii) using knowledge of the error bars, a principled means is
 provided for determining when a sufficient number of compressive-sensing
 measurements have been performed; iii) this setting lends itself
 naturally to a framework whereby the compressive sensing measurements
 are optimized adaptively and hence not determined randomly; and iv) the
 framework accounts for additive noise in the compressive-sensing
 measurements and provides an estimate of the noise variance. In this
 paper we present the underlying theory, an associated algorithm, example
 results, and provide comparisons to other compressive-sensing inversion
 algorithms in the literature.}},

 sensor network in a way that maximizes the information value of the data
 collected is a significant research challenge. Within this context, this
 article concentrates on adaptive sampling as a means of focusing a
 sensor's energy consumption on obtaining the most important data.
 Specifically, we develop a principled information metric based upon
 Fisher information and Gaussian process regression that allows the
 information content of a sensor's observations to be expressed. We then
 use this metric to derive three novel decentralized control algorithms
 for information-based adaptive sampling which represent a trade-off in
 computational cost and optimality. These algorithms are evaluated in the
 context of a deployed sensor network in the domain of flood monitoring.
 The most computationally efficient of the three is shown to increase the
 value of information gathered by approximately 83\%, 27\%, and 8\% per
 day compared to benchmarks that sample in a naive nonadaptive manner, in
 a uniform nonadaptive manner, and using a state-of-the-art adaptive
 sampling heuristic (USAC) correspondingly. Moreover, our algorithm
 collects information whose total value is approximately 75\% of the
 optimal solution (which requires an exponential, and thus impractical,
 amount of time to compute).}},

 sampling theory to sensor data gathering for large-scale wireless sensor
 networks. The successful scheme developed in this research is expected
 to offer fresh frame of mind for research in both compressive sampling
 applications and large-scale wireless sensor networks. We consider the
 scenario in which a large number of sensor nodes are densely deployed
 and sensor readings are spatially correlated. The proposed compressive
 data gathering is able to reduce global scale communication cost without
 introducing intensive computation or complicated transmission control.
 The load balancing characteristic is capable of extending the lifetime
 of the entire sensor network as well as individual sensors. Furthermore,
 the proposed scheme can cope with abnormal sensor readings gracefully.
 We also carry out the analysis of the network capacity of the proposed
 compressive data gathering and validate the analysis through ns-2
 simulations. More importantly, this novel compressive data gathering has
 been tested on real sensor data and the results show the efficiency and
 robustness of the proposed scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {{Energy is a primary constraint in the design and deployment of wireless
 sensor networks (WSNs), since sensor nodes are typically powered by
 batteries with a limited capacity. Energy efficiency is generally
 achieved by reducing radio communication, for instance, limiting
 transmission/reception of data. Data compression can be a valuable tool
 in this direction. The limited resources available in a sensor node
 demand, however, the development of specifically designed compression
 algorithms. In this paper, we propose a simple lossless entropy
 compression (LEC) algorithm which can be implemented in a few lines of
 code, requires very low computational power, compresses data on the fly
 and uses a very small dictionary whose size is determined by the
 resolution of the analog-to-digital converter. We have evaluated the
 effectiveness of LEC by compressing four temperature and relative
 humidity data sets collected by real WSNs, and solar radiation, seismic
 and ECG data sets. We have obtained compression ratios up to 70.81\% and
 62.08\% for temperature and relative humidity data sets, respectively,
 and of the order of 70\% for the other data sets. Then, we have shown
 that LEC outperforms two specifically designed compression algorithms
 for WSNs. Finally, we have compared LEC with gzip, bzip2, rar, classical
 Huffman and arithmetic encodings.}},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work has shown that large gains in communication capacity are achievable by distributed beamforming in sensor networks. The principal challenge in realizing these gains in practice, is in synchronizing the carrier signal of individual sensors in such a way that they combine coherently at the intended receiver. In this paper, we provide a scalable mechanism for achieving phase synchronization in completely distributed fashion, based only on feedback regarding the power of the net received signal. Insight into the workings of the protocol is obtained from a simple theoretical model that provides accurate performance estimates},

  Abstract                 = {Compressibility of individual sequences by the class of generalized finite-state information-lossless encoders is investigated. These encoders can operate in a variable-rate mode as well as a fixed-rate one, and they allow for any finite-state scheme of variable-length-to-variable-length coding. For every individual infinite sequence x a quantity \rho(x) is defined, called the compressibility of x , which is shown to be the asymptotically attainable lower bound on the compression ratio that can be achieved for x by any finite-state encoder. This is demonstrated by means of a constructive coding theorem and its converse that, apart from their asymptotic significance, also provide useful performance criteria for finite and practical data-compression tasks. The proposed concept of compressibility is also shown to play a role analogous to that of entropy in classical information theory where one deals with probabilistic ensembles of sequences rather than with individual sequences. While the definition of \rho(x) allows a different machine for each different sequence to be compressed, the constructive coding theorem leads to a universal algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for all sequences.},
