  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to measure the temporal-spatial field of some scalar physical quantities. Our goal is to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the temporal-spatial field with as little energy as possible. We propose an adaptive algorithm, based on the recently developed theory of adaptive compressive sensing, to collect information from WSNs in an energy efficient manner. The key idea of the algorithm is to perform Â¿projectionsÂ¿ iteratively to maximise the amount of information gain per energy expenditure. We prove that this maximisation problem is NP-hard and propose a number of heuristics to solve this problem. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms using data from both simulation and an outdoor WSN testbed. The results show that our proposed algorithms are able to give a more accurate approximation of the temporal-spatial field for a given energy expenditure.},

 networks using a distributed adaptive signal processing framework and
 efficient algorithm(1). While the topic of energy-aware routing to
 alleviate energy consumption in sensor networks has received attention
 recently {[}1,2]. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal approach to
 previous methods. Specifically, we propose a distributed way of
 continuously exploiting existing correlations in sensor data based on
 adaptive signal processing and distributed source coding principles. Our
 approach enables sensor nodes to blindly compress their readings with
 respect to one another without the need for explicit and
 energy-expensive inter-sensor communication to effect this compression.
 Furthermore, the distributed algorithm used by each sensor node is
 extremely low in complexity and easy to implement (i.e., one modulo
 operation), while an adaptive filtering framework is used at the data
 gathering unit to continuously learn the relevant correlation structures
 in the sensor data. Our simulations show the power of our proposed
 algorithms, revealing their potential to effect significant energy
 savings (from 10\%-65\%) for typical sensor data corresponding to a
 multitude of sensor modalities.}},

In this framework, the nodes of the sensor network collaborate to optimally fit a global function to each of their local measurements. The algorithm is based upon kernel linear regression, where the model takes the form of a weighted sum of local basis functions; this provides an expressive yet tractable class of models for sensor network data. Rather than transmitting data to one another or outside the network, nodes communicate constraints on the model parameters, drastically reducing the communication required. After the algorithm is run, each node can answer queries for its local region, or the nodes can efficiently transmit the parameters of the model to a user outside the network. We present an evaluation of the algorithm based upon data from a 48-node sensor network deployment at the Intel Research - Berkeley Lab, demonstrating that our distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a fast rate and is very robust to packet losses.},

 sampling theory to sensor data gathering for large-scale wireless sensor

 to offer fresh frame of mind for research in both compressive sampling
 applications and large-scale wireless sensor networks. We consider the
 scenario in which a large number of sensor nodes are densely deployed
 and sensor readings are spatially correlated. The proposed compressive
 data gathering is able to reduce global scale communication cost without
 introducing intensive computation or complicated transmission control.
 The load balancing characteristic is capable of extending the lifetime
 of the entire sensor network as well as individual sensors. Furthermore,
 the proposed scheme can cope with abnormal sensor readings gracefully.
 We also carry out the analysis of the network capacity of the proposed
 compressive data gathering and validate the analysis through ns-2
 simulations. More importantly, this novel compressive data gathering has
 been tested on real sensor data and the results show the efficiency and
 robustness of the proposed scheme.},
