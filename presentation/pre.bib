journal = {Journal of Network and Computer Applications},

volume = {35},

pages = {37-59},

abstract = {Power consumption is a critical problem affecting the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. A number of techniques have been proposed to solve this issue, such as energy-efficient medium access control or routing protocols. Among those proposed techniques, the data compression scheme is one that can be used to reduce transmitted data over wireless channels. This technique leads to a reduction in the required inter-node communication, which is the main power consumer in wireless sensor networks. In this article, a comprehensive review of existing data compression approaches in wireless sensor networks is provided. First, suitable sets of criteria are defined to classify existing techniques as well as to determine what practical data compression in wireless sensor networks should be. Next, the details of each classified compression category are described. Finally, their performance, open issues, limitations and suitable applications are analyzed and compared based on the criteria of practical data compression in wireless sensor networks.},

journal = {Ieee Transactions on Signal Processing},

volume = {57},

number = {7},

pages = {2868-2875},

abstract = {In this correspondence, the problem of distributed source coding (DSC) of binary sources with side information at the decoder is addressed. A scheme is proposed based on raptor codes which are a new class of rateless codes. The decoding scheme is adapted to this problem by implementing a message passing strategy between the constituent decoders of raptor codes at each decoding iteration. The case in which the sources are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) processes as well as the more general case in which the sources are modeled as hidden Markov processes (HMPs) are considered. The proposed approach achieves better performance than those achieved by the solutions based on turbo codes, and by the solutions based on regular low density parity check (LDPC) codes when i.i.d. sources are considered. On the other hand, when modeling sources as HMPs, an additional module to exploit the underlying Markovian nature is necessary to achieve good performance.},

title = {Environmental contours using copulas},

journal = {Applied Ocean Research},

volume = {52},

pages = {125-139},

abstract = {A procedure is proposed for constructing environmental contours using copula theory. Copulas are functions that define the multivariate probability distribution of a random vector or a set of random variables, and, thus, also determine their dependence structure. Constructing environmental contours requires knowledge of the joint probability distribution of the environmental variables. In many practical applications, the available statistical data is used to estimate the marginal distributions and the linear correlation matrix, and then the Nataf distribution model is employed to obtain the multivariate probability distribution. It turns out that such an approach implies a particular model of dependence structure defined by a Gaussian copula, which might not always be the appropriate one. In this work, some classes of bivariate copulas are considered for modeling the dependence structure of the environmental variables. We examine measures of association, rank-based methods for estimation of copulas, goodness of fit tests for copulas, and copula selection criteria, and apply them to metocean data from hindcasts of tropical storms and extra-tropical events in the Gulf of Mexico. A formulation is proposed for expressing the variates that define the environmental contours as functions of copulas. It is then applied for computing environmental contours of significant wave height, peak spectral period and wind velocity using the estimated copula models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
